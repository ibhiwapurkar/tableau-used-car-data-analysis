# tableau-used-car-data-analysis

About the Data Set:
 
This dataset is downloaded from Kaggle.com(link is provided in Resources section). A project that focuses on creating a comprehensive analysis of a used car dataset sourced from Craigslist, covering vehicle listings across all regional sites in the United States. This on-going project uses data visualization in Tableau, and data manipulation and sorting in Python. The dataset (which is updated on a regular basis) has a wealth of data on car sales including: Price Condition Manufacturer Latitude/longitude 18 other categories
 
Resources:
 
* DataSet: The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle and is regularly updated. You can access the dataset here. Note that this dataset contains a wide range of information related to used car listings, making it suitable for various analytical purposes.
 
* We have taken this project offline i.e. we have downloaded the data, then clean it, and then use Tableau for data visualization purpose.
 
Project Scope:
 
The goal of the project is to make it easy to analyze the entire used car dataset and provide recommendations to the user who is in market for buying a used car and we are doing it in two important ways:
 
Tableau Visualization: Utilizing Tableau, we will create interactive and insightful visualizations that allow users to gain valuable insights from the dataset. Visualizations will cover various aspects of the data, including pricing trends, geographical distribution of listings, and manufacturer popularity.
 
Python Data Ingestion and Transformation: Python code will be used to ingest, clean i.e. transform the dataset and final export it in a readable CSV file for Tableau to read. Users can filter data based on specific criteria, such as city, price range, manufacturer, and odometer reading. The Python code will enable data exploration and extraction of relevant insights.
 
In conclusion, this project is a great resource for anyone who wants to explore and analyze a large-scale used car dataset from Craigslist. By using Tableau and Python, you can create interactive visualizations and perform in-depth analysis of the data, providing valuable insights into the market for used cars.
 
Recommendations:
 
So far, we have the following recommendations for the users who are in market to buy a used car, based on the data analysis and Tableau visualization dashboards/storyboards:
* The user should prefer a Sedan as a type of the used car.
* The user should not purchase a car manufactured more than seven (7) years ago. The preferable age of the vehicle should be between 3 and 7 years.
* The user should look for a car with odometer readings between 30,000 and 70,000 miles.
* This is given but our analysis shows that the users can get a better deal if they purchase a vehicle with automatic transmission than manual.
 
Areas of improvement:
 
* Concentrate on a single manufacturer rather than attempting a generalized analysis for all.
* Enhance data filtration by taking into account odometer readings; certain readings may be considered as outliers.
* Refine model names and explore the possibility of deducing missing manufacturer names by analyzing the model data.
* Concentrate on a particular geographic location rather than encompassing the entire USA, as vehicle prices can significantly vary from one state to another.
